    <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://codeforgirls.org/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone must learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
    <p> 1.You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</p>
    <p> 2.Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website! </p>
    <p> 3. It's so fun! </p>

    <h3> <b><i>What do you need to create a website?</i></b> </h3>

    <p>Not much!</p>

    <ul>
      <li> A computer (always a good start)</li>
      <li> A text editor (I am using atom) </li>
      <li> A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
      <li> Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
    </ul>
